# A git tag is a movable label, so `uses: actions/checkout@v7` runs whichever
# commit that label points at when the job starts, and the owner of the action
# can repoint it at any time. Pinning to a SHA fixes the code, but it also
# makes the reference unreadable to a human, and that is the weakness this
# guards. A pull request can swap the hash for one taken from an attacker's
# fork while leaving the reassuring `# v7.0.1` comment untouched, and the diff
# then looks exactly like a routine Dependabot bump. Forks share object storage
# with their parent, so such a commit is even reachable under the real
# repository's URL. Only resolving the tag tells the two apart.
#
# Version comments must name exact patch releases, never major tags. A major
# tag such as v7 moves with every release, so checking against it would turn CI
# red the moment upstream ships v7.0.2, for a pin that is still perfectly good.
# Patch tags never move, so this check stays quiet until something is wrong.

# Three outcomes have to stay distinguishable. A tag that resolves prints its
# SHA. A tag that does not exist prints nothing and returns 0, because
# ls-remote reports a missing ref as success. A lookup that could not be made
# at all, from a network failure or a repository that is not there, returns
# non-zero and writes the reason to stderr. Collapsing the last two would let
# an unreachable network read as a verified pin, and swallowing the error under
# set -e would kill the run with no file or line to point at.
